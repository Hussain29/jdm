            The beauty of Montessori is that it is a right “fit” for children
            with a wide array of personalities and learning styles. At Joining
            Dots Montessori, the teacher and parents work together between home
            and school, to help the children learn and develop to their full
            potential. The choice of how your child will be educated during
            their formative years is one of the most important decision you will
            make regarding your child future.<br /><br />
            Our aim is to educate children in a way that promotes independent learning,
            supports emotional growth and embraces differences using Montessori approach.

            "Education is not something which a teacher does, but that its
            natural process which develops spontaneously in the kids” having
            said that over the years I have worked with early childhood
            education and have been a part of Montessori environment for more
            than 7 years. I have realised that working with kids is something
            that I love and have numerous ideas to make this beginning a happy
            one for the kids as well for the parents."
